## The strike is off - for now

UCU members voted to accept the latest proposal which emerged from the negotiations,  64% to 36%. This mean no more strike action in the immediate future.

The accepted proposal contains a number of promises to University staff. If these are not met staff may feel that they need to strike again to ensure they are treated fairly.
